## Introduction

	Welcome to our cafe POS project! The initiative aims to streamline the ordering and payment process at our coffee shop, AnimoBrew, enhancing the 
 customer experience while increasing efficiency in operations. With a focus on modularity and scalability, the project is divided into distinct modules, 
 each designed to address specific aspects of the coffee ordering and transaction process. From placing orders to processing payments and generating receipts, 
 by implementing this system, we will enable smooth and faster transactions for our customers’ satisfaction. The project is a crucial step towards innovation 
 and staying competitive in the evolving technology use of establishments.

	
	Animo Brew has decided to align itself with the Starbucks vision - and thus therefore Animo Brew has adopted a similar menu and beverage offerings as 
 Starbucks. In fact all of our menu items are based on the Starbucks Coffee Menu. Wherein the following criteria are taken into consideration:

Objectives:
1. To enhance customer satisfaction by streamlining the ordering and payment process. 
2. Improve operational efficiency by implementing a modular and scalable POS system
3. Generate a detailed list/receipt of the customer’s purchases.
